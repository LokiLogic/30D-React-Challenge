# ⚛️ 30 Days of React Roadmap

I am following a 30-day React roadmap to build and polish practical components and applications. The plan is split into three phases: fundamentals (components, props, state), side effects & data (hooks, fetch), and advanced topics (routing, context, deployment).

## 🟢 Days 1–10: Components, Props & State (Fundamentals)
I learn how a React app is built from composable pieces (components).

| Day | Exercise |
|---|---|
| Day 1 | "Hello Component" — I created a static `ProfileCard` component with an image, name and bio passed via props. — DONE |
| Day 2 | Conditional Rendering — build a button that shows "Logged In" or "Logged Out" using a ternary operator. |
| Day 3 | Counter App — implement a classic counter using `useState` with Increment and Decrement buttons. |
| Day 4 | List Rendering — render an array (e.g. fruits) using `map()`. |
| Day 5 | Color Toggler — change a component's background color on button click using `useState`. |
| Day 6 | Simple Form — implement a controlled input that displays typed text live beneath the field. |
| Day 7 | Props Drilling — pass data from Parent → Child → Grandchild components. |
| Day 8 | Accordion Menu — create an expandable/collapsible FAQ section. |
| Day 9 | Image Slider — cycle images using state and Next/Prev controls. |
| Day 10 | Static Landing Page — assemble a simple site using Header, Hero and Footer components. |

## 🟡 Days 11–20: Side Effects & Data (Hooks)
I will explore `useEffect`, API calls, and more advanced hooks.

| Day | Exercise |
|---|---|
| Day 11 | Digital Clock — use `useEffect` and `setInterval` to update the time. |
| Day 12 | Window Resizer — display the window width in pixels on resize. |
| Day 13 | Simple Fetch — fetch a random joke from a free API on load (e.g., JokeAPI). |
| Day 14 | Search Filter — filter a list by a search input (e.g., name filtering). |
| Day 15 | To-Do List v1 — add and remove items from a list. |
| Day 16 | To-Do List v2 — add item completion (strike-through) and editing. |
| Day 17 | GitHub User Finder — use the GitHub API to show an entered user's avatar and bio. |
| Day 18 | `useRef` Hook — auto-focus an input when the page loads. |
| Day 19 | Custom Hook — create a reusable `useFetch` hook to abstract fetch logic. |
| Day 20 | Quiz App — build a multi-question quiz with scoring at the end. |

## 🔴 Days 21–30: Advanced React (Router, Context, Deployment)
I will build more complete apps with routing, global state and deploy them.

| Day | Exercise |
|---|---|
| Day 21 | React Router Setup — create a multi-page site (Home, About, Contact) without reloads. |
| Day 22 | Dynamic Routing — build product pages by ID (e.g., `/product/1`). |
| Day 23 | Theme Switcher — implement Dark/Light mode using `useContext` for global state. |
| Day 24 | Shopping Cart (Mini) — add products to a cart and display cart contents using Context. |
| Day 25 | Form Validation — build a registration form with validation messages (e.g., "Password is too short"). |
| Day 26 | Weather App — fetch weather data for a city using a public API. |
| Day 27 | Movie Search App — search movies (e.g., OMDB API) and display posters in a grid. |
| Day 28 | Local Storage — persist the To-Do list or theme setting across refreshes. |
| Day 29 | Refactor & Polish — pick an earlier project, refactor its structure and add comments. |
| Day 30 | Deployment — deploy my best project to Vercel or Netlify. |
