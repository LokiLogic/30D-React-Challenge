# ⚛️ 30 Days of React Roadmap

I am following a 30-day React roadmap to build and polish practical components and applications. The plan is split into three phases: fundamentals (components, props, state), side effects & data (hooks, fetch), and advanced topics (routing, context, deployment).

## 🟢 Days 1–10: Components, Props & State (Fundamentals)
I learn how a React app is built from composable pieces (components).

• **Day 1 — "Hello Component"**: I created a static `ProfileCard` component with an image, name and bio passed via props. — DONE
• **Day 2 — Conditional Rendering**: I will build a button that shows "Logged In" or "Logged Out" using a ternary operator.
• **Day 3 — Counter App**: I will implement a classic counter using `useState` with Increment and Decrement buttons.
• **Day 4 — List Rendering**: I will render an array (e.g. fruits) using `map()`.
• **Day 5 — Color Toggler**: I will change a component's background color on button click using `useState`.
• **Day 6 — Simple Form**: I will implement a controlled input that displays typed text live beneath the field.
• **Day 7 — Props Drilling**: I will pass data from Parent → Child → Grandchild components.
• **Day 8 — Accordion Menu**: I will create an expandable/collapsible FAQ section.
• **Day 9 — Image Slider**: I will cycle images using state and Next/Prev controls.
• **Day 10 — Static Landing Page**: I will assemble a simple site using Header, Hero and Footer components.

## 🟡 Days 11–20: Side Effects & Data (Hooks)
I will explore `useEffect`, API calls, and more advanced hooks.

• **Day 11 — Digital Clock**: I will use `useEffect` and `setInterval` to update the time.
• **Day 12 — Window Resizer**: I will display the window width in pixels on resize.
• **Day 13 — Simple Fetch**: I will fetch a random joke from a free API on load (e.g., JokeAPI).
• **Day 14 — Search Filter**: I will filter a list by a search input (e.g., name filtering).
• **Day 15 — To-Do List v1**: I will add and remove items from a list.
• **Day 16 — To-Do List v2**: I will add item completion (strike-through) and editing.
• **Day 17 — GitHub User Finder**: I will use the GitHub API to show an entered user's avatar and bio.
• **Day 18 — `useRef` Hook**: I will auto-focus an input when the page loads.
• **Day 19 — Custom Hook**: I will create a reusable `useFetch` hook to abstract fetch logic.
• **Day 20 — Quiz App**: I will build a multi-question quiz with scoring at the end.

## 🔴 Days 21–30: Advanced React (Router, Context, Deployment)
I will build more complete apps with routing, global state and deploy them.

• **Day 21 — React Router Setup**: I will create a multi-page site (Home, About, Contact) without reloads.
• **Day 22 — Dynamic Routing**: I will build product pages by ID (e.g., `/product/1`).
• **Day 23 — Theme Switcher**: I will implement Dark/Light mode using `useContext` for global state.
• **Day 24 — Shopping Cart (Mini)**: I will add products to a cart and display cart contents using Context.
• **Day 25 — Form Validation**: I will build a registration form with validation messages (e.g., "Password is too short").
• **Day 26 — Weather App**: I will fetch weather data for a city using a public API.
• **Day 27 — Movie Search App**: I will search movies (e.g., OMDB API) and display posters in a grid.
• **Day 28 — Local Storage**: I will persist the To-Do list or theme setting across refreshes.
• **Day 29 — Refactor & Polish**: I will pick an earlier project, refactor its structure and add comments.
• **Day 30 — Deployment**: I will deploy my best project to Vercel or Netlify.
